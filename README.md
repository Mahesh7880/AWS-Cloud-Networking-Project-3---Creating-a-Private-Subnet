# Creating-a-Private-Subnet
# 🔒 Private Subnet Isolation in Amazon VPC  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **AWS VPC subnet isolation**, ensuring that sensitive resources remain **secure and inaccessible** from the public internet. By leveraging **subnetting, routing, and network ACLs**, I built a **fully private network segment** within an AWS environment.  

## **Project Highlights**  

### **What I Did:**  
🗺️ **Designed a Private Subnet** – Allocated a **CIDR block** that does not overlap with the public subnet.  
🚦 **Configured a Route Table** – Excluded an **Internet Gateway**, ensuring complete isolation from external access.  
🔐 **Implemented a Network ACL (NACL)** – Denied **all inbound and outbound traffic** by default, reinforcing security.  
🖥️ **Explored AWS Networking & Isolation** – Strengthened understanding of **network segmentation & security policies**.  

### **Next Steps:**  
🔄 **VPN & Direct Connect Integration** – Exploring **secure private connectivity** between on-prem and cloud.  
📊 **Logging & Monitoring** – Setting up **VPC Flow Logs** to track **traffic patterns and security events**.  

## **Why This Matters?**  
Private subnets play a key role in **cloud security**, keeping sensitive data and services protected **from external threats**. This hands-on project deepened my skills in **AWS networking and secure cloud design**.
